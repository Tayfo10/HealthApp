# HealthApp
 HealthApp is an iOS application built with SwiftUI, leveraging HealthKit to track and display user health metrics such as steps, weight, and calories burned. The app provides a sleek and user-friendly interface to help users monitor their health over time.
 HealthApp also allows you to upload new step,weight and calories data to the Apple Health app.

- **Permission Priming**: Users are guided through the process of granting necessary permissions.
- **Text Input Validation**: Ensures that user inputs are validated before submission.
- **Basic Unit Tests**: Core functionalities are covered by unit tests to ensure reliability.
- **Basic Accessibility**: The app is designed with accessibility in mind to support a wider range of users.
- **Privacy Manifest**: The app respects user privacy and includes a privacy manifest.
- **Code Documentation (DocC)**: The code is well-documented using Apple's DocC to facilitate understanding and maintenance.
- **Project Organization**: The project is organized following best practices for maintainability and scalability.
